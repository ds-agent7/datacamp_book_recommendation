Charles Darwin is one of the few universal figures of science. His most renowned work is without a doubt his "On the Origin of Species" published in 1859 which introduced the concept of natural selection. But Darwin wrote many other books on a wide range of topics, including geology, plants or his personal life. In this notebook, we will automatically detect how closely related his books are to each other.  

To this purpose, we will develop the bases of a content-based book recommendation system, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are. The methods we will use are commonly used in text- or documents-heavy industries such as legal, tech or customer support to perform some common task such as text classification or handling search engine queries.  

Let's take a look at the books we'll use in our recommendation system.
